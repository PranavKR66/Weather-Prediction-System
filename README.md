# Weather-Prediction-System
**The goal of this project is to predict rainfall based on meteorological data. The steps taken have been outlined below:** 

- **Performed exploratory data analysis on a meteorological data set consisting of 55,000 rows, using statistical analysis and visualization. Filled in missing values using regression and imputation.**
- **Implemented Decision Trees and K-Means clustering algorithms to predict rainfall.**
- **Used Grid Search and k-fold cross validation to tune the hyper-parameters in order to optimize the recall and accuracy of the models.**
- **Predicted Rainfall with an accuracy and recall values of 76 percent.**
